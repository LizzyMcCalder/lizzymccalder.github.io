I have a rough sketch of my Lizzymccalder website. For now, I have different projects in mind. 

<ol>
<li>Lizzy Answers</li>
<li>The sky is the limit</li>
<li>16 years old and writing</li>
<li>The brave light in elderly people</li>

### Lizzy Answers

### The sky is the limit

I have a 16 year old girl inside me. She is not a happy soul, but has when she expresses herself she does so in beautiful poetic language. I would like to try to post some of her poems.
