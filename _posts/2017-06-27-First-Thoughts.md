# First Thoughts

I have a rough sketch of my Lizzymccalder website. For now, I have 3 projects in mind. 

<ol>
<li>Lizzy Answers</li>
<li>The sky is the limit</li>
<li>16 year old poet</li>
</ol>

### Lizzy Answers
I love a challenge and a good question gets me running. This is the place where I will anwer questions of any kind. The only restriction is that they have to get me running. I will try to collect one question every week and answer it of course.

### The sky is the limit
I like making pictures of the trees in the sky. This is where I will collect them.

### 16 year old poet
I have a 16 year old girl inside me. She is not a happy soul, but has when she expresses herself she does so in beautiful poetic language. I would like to try to post some of her poems.
