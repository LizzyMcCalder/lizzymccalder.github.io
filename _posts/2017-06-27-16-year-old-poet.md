# 16 Year Old Poet

maybe the real good metaphors are not metaphors but truths of life itself and we their carriers instead of language.

### 1
black cold empty


i think little


i sensitize


i hover


through the universe perhaps


far far away


i am the lonely star



### 2
behind my eyes


i burst and implode


no escape



### 3
i cry



### 4
i cry 


perhaps


perhaps you too


i could stretch out stretch.



### 5
i cry


i am there


are you there


i am here


will you come


i am here still


i am here still


will you come



### 6
i cry


from on top



### 7
and again i was crying



total desole


housing in


over



### 8
i float


i am me


i am


i am there


i am good


i am alive



### 9
sad


a bone
