# 16 Year Old Poet

### Day 1
This is what I often think: Maybe the real good metaphors are not metaphors but truths of life itself and we their carriers instead of language.

### Day 2
black cold empty
i think little
i sensitize
i hover
through the universe perhaps
far far away
i am the lonely star

### Day 3
behind my eyes
i burst and implode
no escape

### Day 4
i cry

### Day 5
i cry 
perhaps
perhaps you too
i could stretch out stretch.

### Day 6
i cry
i am there
are you there
i am here
will you come
i am here still
i am here still
will you come

### Day 7
i cry
from on top

### Day 8
and again i was crying
total desole
housing in
over

### Day 9
i float
i am me
i am
i am there
i am good
i am alive

### Day 10
sad
a bone
