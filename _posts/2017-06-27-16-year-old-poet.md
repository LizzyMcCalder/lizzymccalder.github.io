# 16 Year Old Poet

maybe the real good metaphors are not metaphors but truths of life itself and we their carriers instead of language.

### 1

black cold and empty


i think little


i feel


i hover


through the universe perhaps


far far away


i am the lonely star




### 2

behind my eyes


i burst and implode


no escape




### 3

 i cry



### 4

i cry 


perhaps


perhaps you too


if so


i could stretch out 


and stretch




### 5

i cry


i am there


are you there


i am here


will you come


i am here still


i am here still


will you come




### 6

i cry


from on top




### 7



and again i was crying


total loneliness


housing in


it's over




### 8

i am floating


i am me


i am


i am there


i am good


i am alive




### 9

sad


as a bone
