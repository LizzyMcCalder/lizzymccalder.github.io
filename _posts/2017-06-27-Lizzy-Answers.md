* What's wrong with saying *It was just meant to be*?

We all know these conversations where one person explains a positive or negative change in life situation to another person. We all know the desire to try to make sense of these changes. Why did they happen, what caused them to happen and how should we assess it. We also know that sometimes we don't know the answers to these questions. And for those sometimes, we often say: "I guess it was just meant to be." Intuitively, something seems to be wrong here. 

### Why it feels wrong

### Why it is often argumentatively at fault

### When it does make sense

### Do's and don'ts
