* What's wrong with saying *It was just meant to be? *

We all know these conversations where one person explains a positive or negative change in life situation to another person. We all know the desire to try to make sense of these changes. Why did it happen and how should we come to terms with it? Most of us also know that sometimes - or very often depending on how confident you are - we don't know the answers to these questions. And for those sometimes, we often say: "I guess it was just meant to be." Intuitively, something seems to be wrong here. But what?

### Why it feels wrong
It feels wrong because it is not a satisfying answer. To neither partners. When you utter it you do not feel like you are really helping the other. When someone says it to you, you don't feel like you have been helped. Have you ever build a sandcastle? When you pour water over it, the sand looses its adhesive qualities and collapses. This is precisely how it feels when you try to make sense of something and the answer you get is: "I guess it was just meant to be". Or when you utter it to someone who is in moral distress. It is actually more an expression of a shortcoming then anything else. You admit the now laid bare fact that you don't know the answer.

### Why it is often argumentatively at fault
It is not an argument! I will show you why. Suppose we try to spell out the argument in full. Then it would read something like: "There is a world out there, where life situations happen because of a chain of cause and effect that we cannot really grasp. The fact that we cannot grasp it only shows that this is the case, thus; this is the case." Or: I guess it was just meant to be.  
Interestingly, there are two levels at stake here. A deterministic one of cause and effect and a spiritual one meaningful and meaningless situations. 

### When it does make sense
What is behind our use of the phrase? Why do we even begin to utter such a comment if it feels wrong and if it is even argumentatively off the chart? The answer seens easy; we are trying to console the other person's worries or comfort them. This makes sense and is even kind and goodharted. Another reason is to admit to our modesty as to understanding the world around us. This too makes sense and is an admirable trait. 

### Do's and don'ts
